## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla Javascript
- Sass for styling
- Figma for design
- Node Sass for development
- Netlify for deployment

### What I learned

My goal with this project was to keep things simple and see how the work I've put into my coding over the past several months has helped to develop my skills, and to start understanding how long projects like this take for me to design. I wanted to focus on planning the project well, writing clean JavaScript, using HTML semantics, and writing custom CSS classes.

I guessed this project would take about 10 days for me to finish. I was able to complete it in half that time, which was a pleasant surprise.

### Continued development

I'd like to focus my energies more on JavaSript for the next project or two, give tha this projec did not have much functionality. Almost half my time was spent on media queries, which I'm not entirely sure is a normal. I'd like to maybe skip these for the next project or find if there's a better way to make responsive designs.
