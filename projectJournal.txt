	OK, last project went well. I'm expecting this project to be fairly similar because it's another multi-page website. CSS grid heavy, but nothing crazy. Not much intro to this one.
Just going to dive in.

Project Goals:
	1. Gameplan this project really well.
	2. Continue to improve my HTML, CSS, and JS skills.
	3. Keep my code clear, clean, concise.
	4. CSS Grid in particular.
	5. I'm going to look over the project and estimate how long this will take. Should start getting a better feel for this kind of thing. Last project took 7 days to complete. This
	   is a bit bigger, but shouldn't take that much longer. Let's say this will be a 10 day project. I'll consider off-days a complete day and work-days a half day. 

Each day I code, I'm going to make a journal entry with the following structure:
	A. What I plan to do today.
	B. What I ended up doing today.
	C. Any problems/issues/bugs that came up today.
	D. How I solved those problems/issues/bugs.
	E. Lessons from today

Day 1 - 6/22/21
	A. What I plan to do today is go through the readme to fully understand the project, get the GitHub repo up, and write out the HTML.
	B. 
	C. 
	D. 
	E. Npm is becoming annoying. It seems to behave differently every time I start a new project. Not sure why.
