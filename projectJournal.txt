	OK, last project went well. I'm expecting this project to be fairly similar because it's another multi-page website. CSS grid heavy, but nothing crazy. Not much intro to this one.
Just going to dive in.

Project Goals:
	1. Gameplan this project really well.
	2. Continue to improve my HTML, CSS, and JS skills.
	3. Keep my code clear, clean, concise.
	4. CSS Grid in particular.
	5. I'm going to look over the project and estimate how long this will take. Should start getting a better feel for this kind of thing. Last project took 7 days to complete. This
	   is a bit bigger, but shouldn't take that much longer. Let's say this will be a 10 day project. I'll consider off-days a complete day and work-days a half day. 

Each day I code, I'm going to make a journal entry with the following structure:
	A. What I plan to do today.
	B. What I ended up doing today.
	C. Any problems/issues/bugs that came up today.
	D. How I solved those problems/issues/bugs.
	E. Lessons from today

Day 1 - 6/22/21
	A. What I plan to do today is go through the readme to fully understand the project, get the GitHub repo up, and write out the HTML.
	B. What I did today was go through the Readme, get the repo up, write the html and css for the home and stories pages.
	C. 
	D. 
	E. Npm is becoming annoying. It seems to behave differently every time I start a new project. Not sure why. This was way more than I intended, but that seems like a good thing.

Day 2 - 6/23/21
	A. What I plan to do today is finish the third page (features) entirely.
	B. What I did today was finish the third and fourth pages. Which is everything for the desktop version, html, css, js.
	C.
	D.
	E. This project was very easy. I can't believe how quickly it went. I almost don't want to do the mobile bc of how simple the desktop was, but I'm going to do it anyway. I'm super
	   pumped.

Day 3 - 6/24/21
	A. What I plan to do today is the tablet media queries.
	B. 
	C. 
	D.
